# Resume_Tailor_AI_Langchain

**Resume Tailor AI**
This project provides a pipeline to semantically match your resume content against a job description and then uses the Gemini AI model to rewrite the most relevant parts of your resume to better align with the job requirements.

**Prerequisites**
  Python 3.11 or higher
  Access to the Google Gemini API. You will need a Google API key.

**Project Workflow**
The project follows these main steps:

**Step 1**: Resume Ingestion Pipeline
This part of the code processes your resume PDF.

  1. Extract Text: Reads the entire text content from your resume PDF.
  2. Extract Links: Identifies and extracts any external links (like GitHub or LinkedIn profiles) present in the PDF.
  3. Chunk Text with Metadata: Splits the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks (documents) and attaches the extracted links as              metadata to each chunk. This helps in retaining context and including relevant links during the rewriting phase.
  4. Embed Documents: Converts each text chunk into a numerical vector representation (embedding) using the Gemini embedding-001 model. These         embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text. The embeddings are also normalized.
  5. Build and Save Vectorstore: Creates a FAISS vector store from the embedded resume chunks and their corresponding vectors. This vector store      allows for efficient similarity search. The vector store is saved locally for later use.

**Step 2**: Job Description Ingestion Pipeline
This part processes the job description provided as a string.

  1. Chunk Job Description: Splits the job description text into smaller chunks.
  2. Embed Job Description: Converts each job description chunk into a numerical vector representation using the same Gemini embedding-001 model.
  3. Build and Save Vectorstore: Creates and saves a separate FAISS vector store for the job description chunks and their embeddings.

**Step 3**: Semantic Matching Engine
This step compares the resume and job description to find the most relevant parts of your resume for the job.

  1. Load Vectorstores: Loads the previously saved FAISS vector stores for both the resume and the job description.
  2. Compute Similarity Matrix: Calculates the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of all job description chunks and all resume           chunks. This matrix indicates how semantically similar each job description chunk is to each resume chunk.
  3. Rank Resume Matches: For each job description chunk, it finds the top k most similar resume chunks based on the similarity matrix. The           relevant links associated with the matched resume chunks are also included.

**Step 4**: Resume Rewriter + Humanizer using Gemini (LLM)
This is the core of the resume tailoring process.

  1. Gemini Setup: Initializes the Gemini model (gemini-1.5-flash in this case) for generating rewritten text, using your provided API key.
  2. Prompt Template: Defines a prompt structure that instructs the Gemini model to rewrite a given resume chunk to better match a specific job       description chunk, while maintaining bullet point format and optionally including relevant links.
  3. Rewrite Resume Matches: Iterates through the top matches found in the previous step. For each pair of job description chunk and matched          resume chunk, it constructs a prompt using the prompt template and sends it to the Gemini model for rewriting. Includes rate limiting to         manage API calls.
  4. Display Results: Prints the original resume chunk, the corresponding job description context, the similarity score, and the rewritten            resume chunk generated by the Gemini model.

This process provides a tailored version of your resume content based on the specific job description, aiming to highlight the most relevant experiences and skills.
